				Dear <span class="username"></span>, <br><br>
				
				The report of our investigator regarding Mr. Wright have definitely produced an unsolved mystery in front of us. The vanishing of Mrs. Wright has even deepened the case. Moreover the fact that Mr. Wright himself was never seen in person, neither by us nor by the witnesses, raises many doubts. In fact, there are dozens of questions that are left unanswered, and given the current condition, of us being clueless, it seems very less likely that we would be able to solve this mystery any soon. (maybe never!) Nevertheless, the foiling of the cyber crimes of COATIS, in itself, is a huge accomplishment.<br><br>

				Your internship programme has finally come to an end. Your work during this time period has been really appreciable, and hopefully, you would also have earned many useful Cryptography skills as well as a valuable life experience. 
				One last mini assignment and then you will be an Agil Certified Cryptographer.<br><br>
				
				You can collect your reward and your certificate from our headquarter anytime during our working hours. You have also been mentioned in few newspapers which covered the case of COATIS. Selected News Excerpts have been attached with this letter for your viewing. Definitely such records will prove very beneficial in your future career prospects.<br>
				Finally, to remind you of the Non Disclosure Agreement that you signed on the first day, we expect you to be completely secretive of the cases that you worked on as well as the inner workings of our corporation.<br><br>

				It was nice working with you.<br>
				Take care.<br>

				<h5>THE CYBER TERRORIST GROUP COATIS UNCOVERED</h5><br>

				The geniuses at Agil Investigation Inc. have uncovered the dangerous cyber terrorist organization called COATIS. It was held responsible for spreading and controling the ransomware called CryptoRansom. Fero Systems have also been convicted of being deeply involved in this crime. The Director of Agil, Christopher Nott, told the media, "It has been only made possible by the collaborative, sincere and timely efforts of our Cryptography and Cyber Crime division headed by Earle Smith, our investigator Ambrose Moore and the Spellborough Police." Earle Smith added on this, "This has been a huge accomplishment. If we wouldn't have stopped them (COATIS) today, then the future would've surely seen terrible cyber disasters. Our team of cryptographers namely Theodore Nott, Rickert Wilson and <span class="username"></span> have done admirable jobs".<br>
				Exposing of COATIS is surely a pleasant sign of relief for everyone, but this incident has also announced to all, the possibilities - good and bad - that reside in the realm of cyber security and cryptography. While it can be seen as viable career option, it also poses some dangerous threats. We surely need to be more aware and careful than ever. Hopefully we are safe now, but realistically, we need to be safer.<br><br>

				<h5>FERO SYSTEMS CAUGHT IN THE CYBER RANSOM BUSINESS</h5><br>
				
				With the combined efforts of Agil Investigation Inc. and the Spellborough Police Department, the famous Mainframe company - Fero Systems was exposed on Monday after it was found fostering a cyber crime organization called COATIS. COATIS used their virus to encrypt the digital files of users, and then asked huge amount of ransom to decrypt it back. They had nearly thousands of victims worldwide and were evading the Police by using TOR and bitcoins for anonymous payments. Cyber Security Experts have advised the public to be very careful while browsing suspicious websites and while opening unsolicited emails, as this was the COATIS's method of propagation of virus. Today, in the interconnected world of Internet, awareness of Cyber Security certainly demands more focus than ever.<br><br>

			The news covered the technical details very well, but mentioned nothing about the trail of cipher clues, the incidents related to Wrights, or the puzzling mystery!<br><br>

			It seems as if those incidents have been kept secret from media.
