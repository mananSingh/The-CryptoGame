				<strong>OBJECTIVE</strong>: Decipher the message.<br><br>
				<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>: Our client Mrs. Tamsyn Wright has reported her husband missing from longer than a week. She has a letter that he has written to her, but the contents of that letter are cryptic to her senses, as they are encrypted using Caesar Cipher. We have found the related information necessary to decrypt that code, and have mentioned that below. Your task is to submit to us the original message after decryption.<br> <br>
				<strong>CIPHER INFO</strong>: Caesar Cipher. Key: 13. <br>

				Dear Tamsyn,<br>
				Yesterday, I had to hastily leave out of town due to a surprise meeting, and so, was unable to describe to you the details of this trip. I am very sorry for that. Regretfully, I cannot share those details even now, as the gravity of the matters surrounding this trip have dramatically increased today.<br>
				Don't worry though, as I will surely return back before our anniversary on 26th, and we'll celebrate at the Laurel's.<br>
				Take care.<br><br>
				
				With love.<br>
				Yours forever,<br>
				Thomas Wright<br><br>

			What could possibly be written in that encrypted text? His whereabouts? Some note? Just a prank? or, some Warning?!<br><br>

			Time to find out yourself. (Hint: Use the Caesar Tool from <a target="_blank" href="cryptolab.html" style="color:teal">Cryptolab</a>)<br>
