We can neither decrypt nor crack that encryption. Only one who owns the private key can decrypt those files.\n\nDETAILS: Not only the files are encrypted using AES or Advanced Encryption Standard, but the 256-bit AES key needed to decrypt those files is also encrypted; and that too with the strong asymmetric key algorithm, namely the RSA. \nKnowing the AES key, anyone can decrypt the files. But the AES key is encrypted using RSA public key; and to decrypt that, one needs to know the corresponding RSA private key associated with that public key.\nWithout knowing the RSA private key, we cannot decrypt those files.
